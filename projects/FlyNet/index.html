	Visual navigation tasks in real world environments
	often require both self-motion and place recognition feedback.
	While deep reinforcement learning has shown success in solving
	these perception and decision-making problems in an end-toend
	manner, these algorithms require large amounts of experience
	to learn navigation policies from high-dimensional inputs,
	which is generally impractical for real robots due to sample
	complexity. In this paper, we address these problems with two
	main contributions.We first leverage place recognition and deep
	learning techniques combined with goal destination feedback
	to generate compact, bimodal images representations that can
	then be used to effectively learn control policies at kilometer
	scale from a small amount of experience. Second, we present
	an interactive and realistic framework, called CityLearn, that
	enables for the first time the training of navigation algorithms
	across city-sized, real-world environments with extreme environmental
	changes. CityLearn features over 10 benchmark
	real-world datasets often used in place recognition research
	with more than 100 recorded traversals and across 60 cities
	around the world. We evaluate our approach in two CityLearn
	environments where our navigation policy is trained using a
	single traversal. Results show our method can be over 2 orders
	of magnitude faster than when using raw images and can also
	generalize across extreme visual changes including day to night
	and summer to winter transitions.

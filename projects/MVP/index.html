	Autonomous navigation emerges from both motion and local visual perception
  in real-world environments. How- ever, most successful robotic motion estimation
  methods (e.g. VO, SLAM, SfM) and vision systems (e.g. CNN, visual place recognition–VPR)
  are often separately used for mapping and localization tasks. Conversely, recent
  reinforcement learning (RL) based methods for visual navigation rely on the quality of
  GPS data reception, which may not be reliable when directly using it as ground truth
  across multiple, month-spaced traver- sals in large environments. In this paper, we
  propose a novel motion and visual perception approach, dubbed MVP, that unifies these
  two sensor modalities for large-scale, target-driven navigation tasks. Our MVP-based
  method can learn faster, and is more accurate and robust to both extreme environmental
  changes and poor GPS data than corresponding vision-only navigation methods. MVP temporally
  incorporates compact image representations, obtained using VPR, with optimized motion
  estimation data, including but not limited to those from VO or optimized radar odometry
  (RO), to efficiently learn self-supervised navigation policies via RL. We evaluate our
  method on two large real-world datasets, Oxford Robotcar and Nordland Railway, over a
  range of weather (e.g. overcast, night, snow, sun, rain, clouds) and seasonal (e.g. winter,
  spring, fall, summer) conditions using the new CityLearn framework; an interactive environment
  for efficiently training navigation agents. Our experimental results, on traversals of the
  Oxford RobotCar dataset with no GPS data, show that MVP can achieve 53% and 93% navigation
  success rate using VO and RO, respectively, compared to 7% for a vision-only method. We
  additionally report a trade-off between the RL success rate and the motion estimation
  precision, suggesting that vision- only navigation systems can benefit from using precise
  motion estimation techniques to improve their overall performance.
